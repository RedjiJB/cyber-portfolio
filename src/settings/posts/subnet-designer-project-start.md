# 🚀 Starting the Subnet Designer & Visualizer Project

> **TL;DR**: Building a Python-powered VLSM calculator and network topology visualizer to bridge theory and practice in my networking studies at Algonquin College.

---

## 📖 The Story Behind This Project

As I dive deeper into my **Computer Systems Technician - Networking** program at Algonquin College, I've been tackling some fascinating concepts in **CST 8182 (Introduction to Computer Networking)**. While learning about IPv4 addressing, subnetting, and VLSM has been intellectually stimulating, I found myself craving a more hands-on approach to truly master these concepts.

That's when the idea struck: **Why not build a tool that not only solves subnetting problems but also visualizes the results?**

Enter the **Subnet Designer & Visualizer** project—a comprehensive Python application that will transform abstract networking concepts into tangible, visual understanding.

## 🛠️ Technical Deep Dive

### 🐍 Python Libraries & Architecture

After extensive research, here's my technology stack:

#### **Core Networking Libraries**
```python
# Built-in powerhouse for IP operations
import ipaddress
from ipaddress import IPv4Network, IPv4Address

# Advanced network calculations
import netaddr
from netaddr import IPNetwork, IPSet

# Example: Basic subnet calculation
def calculate_subnet_mask(hosts_required):
    """Calculate minimum subnet mask for given host count"""
    import math
    # Add 2 for network and broadcast addresses
    total_addresses = hosts_required + 2
    # Find the next power of 2
    subnet_bits = math.ceil(math.log2(total_addresses))
    host_bits = 32 - subnet_bits
    return f"/{host_bits}"
```

#### **Visualization & UI Stack**
```python
# For network topology diagrams
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.patches as patches
import networkx as nx

# Interactive plotting
import plotly.graph_objects as go
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots

# GUI framework (considering both options)
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk
# Alternative: PyQt5 for more advanced UI
```

## 💭 Final Thoughts

Starting this project feels like the perfect bridge between my academic learning and practical skill development. It's not just about building a tool—it's about deeply understanding the concepts that will form the foundation of my networking career.

The combination of theoretical knowledge (VLSM, network design), practical programming (Python, algorithms), and professional documentation (visual design, technical writing) creates a comprehensive learning experience that goes far beyond any single course assignment.

Most importantly, by open-sourcing this project and documenting my journey, I hope to contribute something valuable back to the student community that has supported my learning.
