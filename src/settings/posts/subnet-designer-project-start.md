# Starting the Subnet Designer & Visualizer Project

> **Executive Summary**: Building a Python-powered VLSM calculator and network topology visualizer to bridge theory and practice in my networking studies at Algonquin College.

---

## Project Background and Motivation

As I progress through my **Computer Systems Technician - Networking** program at Algonquin College, I've been diving deep into the concepts taught in **CST 8182 (Introduction to Computer Networking)**. While the theoretical aspects of IPv4 addressing, subnetting, and Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) are intellectually engaging, I recognized the need for a more hands-on approach to master these fundamental networking concepts.

This realization led to the conception of the **Subnet Designer & Visualizer** project—a comprehensive Python application designed to transform abstract networking principles into tangible, visual understanding while serving as a practical tool for network design and documentation.

### Core Algorithm Design

#### VLSM Allocation Algorithm

```python
def calculate_vlsm_allocation(base_network, requirements):
    """
    Calculate optimal VLSM allocation for given requirements
    
    Parameters:
    - base_network: str (e.g., "192.168.1.0/24")
    - requirements: list of tuples [(name, host_count), ...]
    
    Returns:
    - allocation_plan: dict with subnet assignments
    """
    import ipaddress
    import math
    
    # Sort requirements by host count (descending)
    sorted_requirements = sorted(requirements, 
                               key=lambda x: x[1], 
                               reverse=True)
    
    base = ipaddress.IPv4Network(base_network)
    available_addresses = list(base.hosts())
    allocation_plan = {}
    
    for subnet_name, host_count in sorted_requirements:
        # Calculate required subnet size
        required_size = 2 ** math.ceil(math.log2(host_count + 2))
        subnet_bits = 32 - math.log2(required_size)
        
        # Find available space and allocate
        # Implementation details would go here
