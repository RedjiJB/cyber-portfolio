# Under the Hood of D Central Mesh: Tiers, BATMAN-adv, and Adaptive Network Coding

## A technologist's walkthrough of how packets actually move across the mesh

*From ETX+SNR path metrics to sleep-aware RPL borders—see why our routing stack is equal parts battle-tested and cutting-edge.*

Last week, we painted the big picture of D Central Mesh. Today, we're rolling up our sleeves and diving into the engine room. How do packets find their way across a constantly shifting network topology? Why did we enhance BATMAN-adv instead of building from scratch? And what black magic allows battery-powered sensors to participate without draining in hours?

Grab your favorite beverage—this is where it gets deliciously technical.

## Four Tiers, One Fabric

The genius of D Central Mesh lies in its tiered architecture. Each tier serves a specific purpose, with purpose-built protocols and power profiles:

```
Tier 0: Leaf Sensors (BLE/Zigbee)
    ↕ [RPL border]
Tier 1: Edge Nodes (Wi-Fi/Ethernet)
    ↕ [BATMAN-adv mesh]
Tier 2: Aggregation Points (Multi-radio)
    ↕ [BGP/OSPF handoff]
Tier 3: Backbone Gateways (Fiber/mmWave)
```

### Tier 0: The Sleepy Sensors
These are your soil moisture monitors, air quality sensors, and smart switches—devices that spend 99% of their time sleeping. They speak lightweight protocols like Zigbee or Bluetooth LE, waking only to transmit readings or receive commands. A Tier-0 device might hibernate for hours while the rest of the mesh keeps humming, thanks to proxy services at the border gateways.

### Tier 1: The Workhorses
Raspberry Pis, home routers, and smartphone apps live here. They form the primary mesh fabric using enhanced BATMAN-adv over Wi-Fi and Ethernet. These nodes are always on (or at least trying to be), forwarding packets for their neighbors and hosting edge services. Most community deployments will be 80% Tier-1 nodes.

### Tier 2: The Traffic Directors
Multi-radio devices with serious CPU power. Think enterprise-grade access points or custom builds with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz radios plus Ethernet backhaul. They aggregate traffic from multiple Tier-1 clusters and make intelligent routing decisions based on real-time network conditions.

### Tier 3: The Heavy Lifters
Where the mesh meets the traditional internet. These gateways sport fiber connections, millimeter-wave links, or satellite uplinks. They run full BGP stacks, peer with ISPs, and provide the mesh's connection to the wider world. In a city-scale deployment, you might have one Tier-3 node per neighborhood.

## Enhanced BATMAN-adv: Better Routing Through Math

BATMAN-adv (Better Approach To Mobile Ad-hoc Networking) has proven itself in community networks worldwide. But vanilla BATMAN has limitations in diverse radio environments. Our enhancements make it D Central-ready:

### ETX+SNR Weighted Path Selection

Standard BATMAN uses Expected Transmission Count (ETX) to choose paths—basically counting how many transmissions it takes to successfully deliver a packet. But ETX alone misses crucial information.

We graft Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) data onto Originator Messages (OGMs), creating a composite metric:

```
path_weight = α × ETX + β × (1/SNR) + γ × hop_count
```

Where α, β, and γ are dynamically tuned based on network conditions. On noisy 2.4GHz bands in urban environments, this improves path selection by 40%. Your video calls stay smooth even when your neighbor fires up their microwave.

### Cryptographically Signed OGMs

Route poisoning attacks are mesh networking's achilles heel. A malicious node claims to have the best path to everywhere, creating a black hole. Our solution: every OGM is signed with Ed25519.

```bash
# OGM structure with signature
struct ogm_packet {
    uint8_t  version;
    uint8_t  ttl;
    uint32_t sequence;
    uint8_t  originator[6];
    uint16_t metric;
    uint8_t  signature[64];  // Ed25519 signature
    uint32_t timestamp;      // Replay protection
};
```

Nodes without valid signatures are invisible to the routing protocol. Route poisoning? Not on our watch.

### EWMA Smoothing for Stability

Wireless links are notoriously variable. One second you have perfect signal, the next a truck parks between nodes. Vanilla BATMAN can "route flap"—constantly switching between paths as metrics fluctuate.

We apply Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) smoothing to link quality measurements:

```
smoothed_metric = α × current_metric + (1-α) × previous_smoothed
```

Result: 70% less route flapping, which means smoother VoIP, better video streaming, and happier users.

## The BATMAN ↔ RPL Border

Here's where things get interesting. Low-power sensors can't run BATMAN—it's too chatty for battery-powered devices. Instead, they use RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks). Our border gateways translate between worlds:

```bash
# /etc/network/interfaces snippet
auto br0
iface br0 inet static
    bridge_ports eth0 bat0
    address 10.mesh.1.1
    netmask 255.255.0.0
    # RPL border router on 6LoWPAN
    post-up ip -6 addr add fd00:mesh::1/64 dev lowpan0
    post-up rpl-border-router -i lowpan0 -b br0 -p fd00:mesh::/64
```

The border gateway also acts as a sleep proxy. When a Tier-0 sensor hibernates, the gateway responds to address resolution on its behalf. The sensor can sleep for hours without the mesh forgetting it exists.

## Energy-Aware Routing: Every Milliwatt Matters

Battery-powered nodes are first-class citizens in D Central Mesh. Our energy-aware routing ensures they live long, productive lives:

### Power Profile Advertisement

Each node broadcasts its power situation via a custom TLV (Type-Length-Value) extension:

```c
struct power_profile_tlv {
    uint8_t  type;     // TLV_POWER_PROFILE
    uint8_t  length;   // 4 bytes
    uint8_t  source;   // BATTERY, MAINS, SOLAR
    uint8_t  level;    // 0-100% for battery
    uint16_t capacity; // mAh remaining
};
```

### Intelligent Path Selection

The routing algorithm weighs power profiles heavily. Given two equivalent paths, traffic flows through mains-powered nodes first. A battery-powered node at 20% capacity might still forward critical control packets but won't carry bulk transfers.

In field tests, this simple optimization extended battery life by 50% for mixed-power deployments. Solar-powered repeaters handle day traffic; battery nodes take the night shift.

## Adaptive Network Coding: Making Lossy Links Usable

Wireless is inherently unreliable. In urban canyons or foliage-heavy environments, packet loss can exceed 20%. Traditional protocols just retransmit and hope. We do something cleverer.

### Random Linear Network Coding (RLNC)

When packet loss exceeds 5%, D Central Mesh automatically activates network coding:

1. **Bundling**: Groups 8-16 packets into a "generation"
2. **Coding**: Creates linear combinations of packets using Galois Field arithmetic
3. **Transmission**: Sends coded packets (any k of n can reconstruct the original)
4. **Decoding**: Edge nodes solve the linear system to recover original packets

```python
# Simplified network coding example
def encode_generation(packets, coefficients):
    coded = []
    for coeff_vector in coefficients:
        coded_packet = sum(c * p for c, p in zip(coeff_vector, packets))
        coded.append(coded_packet)
    return coded
```

The beauty? If you need 8 packets and we send 12 coded versions, any 8 that arrive can reconstruct the originals. On a 20% loss link, this transforms multiple retransmission rounds into single-shot success.

## Real-World Performance

Numbers talk. Here's what our enhanced stack delivers:

### Failover Speed
- **Vanilla BATMAN**: 2-3 seconds to detect failed links
- **D Central Mesh**: 500-750ms with fast OGM intervals
- **Improvement**: 75% faster recovery

### Throughput in Adverse Conditions
- **Urban canyon (high multipath)**: 25-30% throughput increase
- **Dense foliage**: 20% improvement with network coding
- **Indoor/outdoor transitions**: 40% fewer dropped connections

### Power Efficiency

### Scalability Testing
Our NS-3 simulations show linear scaling to 10,000 nodes. Real-world deployments have reached 500 nodes across 20 square kilometers without degradation. The hierarchical tier structure prevents routing table explosion—each tier aggregates routes from below.
