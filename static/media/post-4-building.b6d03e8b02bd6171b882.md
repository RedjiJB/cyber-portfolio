# From Edge AI to CRDT Storage: Shipping Apps on D Central Mesh

## How the service registry, container conventions, and GitOps pipeline turn infrastructure into a developer playground

*K3s on a Raspberry Pi, WASM functions on a router, model inference on your phone—the mesh is an app platform hiding in plain sight.*

---

Infrastructure is only as valuable as what you build on it. While traditional networks just move packets, D Central Mesh provides a complete application platform at the edge. Today, we'll explore how developers can deploy services across the mesh, from simple web apps to distributed AI systems.

Whether you're building a neighborhood social network or a city-scale IoT platform, the mesh has you covered. Let's dive into the tools, patterns, and possibilities.

## The Service Registry: Your App's Phone Book

At the heart of D Central's application layer sits the service registry—a distributed, eventually-consistent database of available services. Think of it as DNS meets Kubernetes service discovery, designed for mesh networks.

### Service Manifest Structure

Every service declares its capabilities via a JSON manifest:

```json
{
  "service": {
    "name": "neighborhood-weather",
    "version": "2.1.0",
    "description": "Hyperlocal weather data aggregation",
    "capabilities": ["temperature", "humidity", "air_quality"],
    "requirements": {
      "cpu": "arm64",
      "memory": "512MB",
      "storage": "1GB",
      "tier": ">=1"
    },
    "interfaces": [
      {
        "protocol": "http",
        "port": 8080,
        "path": "/api/v2"
      },
      {
        "protocol": "mqtt",
        "port": 1883,
        "topics": ["weather/+/temperature", "weather/+/humidity"]
      }
    ],
    "dependencies": [
      {
        "service": "time-sync",
        "version": ">=1.0.0"
      }
    ],
    "healthcheck": {
      "endpoint": "/health",
      "interval": "30s",
      "timeout": "5s"
    },
    "placement": {
      "strategy": "edge-preferred",
      "replicas": 3,
      "constraints": ["battery-power-allowed"]
    }
  }
}
```

This manifest tells the mesh everything it needs to know: where the service can run, what it provides, and how to keep it healthy.

### Discovery Flow in JavaScript

Here's how applications find and use services:

```javascript
import { MeshServiceClient } from '@dcentral/mesh-sdk';

// Initialize client with local mesh node
const mesh = new MeshServiceClient({
  nodeAddress: process.env.MESH_NODE || 'localhost:7777',
  certificate: process.env.MESH_CERT_PATH
});

// Discover available weather services
async function getLocalWeather() {
  try {
    // Query registry for weather services
    const services = await mesh.discover({
      capability: 'temperature',
      maxHops: 3,  // Prefer nearby services
      minVersion: '2.0.0'
    });
    
    if (services.length === 0) {
      throw new Error('No weather services available');
    }
    
    // Select best service based on latency and load
    const selected = mesh.selectOptimal(services, {
      strategy: 'latency-weighted',
      timeout: 1000
    });
    
    // Create authenticated client
    const weatherClient = await mesh.createClient(selected, {
      retry: 3,
      timeout: 5000,
      fallbackServices: services.slice(1)  // Automatic failover
    });
    
    // Make API call
    const data = await weatherClient.get('/api/v2/current', {
      location: 'node-7-garden-sensor'
    });
    
    return data;
    
  } catch (error) {
    // Fallback to cached data if available
    return mesh.getCachedData('weather', { maxAge: 3600 });
  }
}

// Subscribe to service availability changes
mesh.on('service:available', (service) => {
  console.log(`New service discovered: ${service.name}@${service.node}`);
});

mesh.on('service:unavailable', (service) => {
  console.log(`Service went offline: ${service.name}@${service.node}`);
});
```

The SDK handles all the complexity: service discovery, load balancing, authentication, and failover. Your app just makes calls.

## Container Conventions: Package Once, Run Anywhere (on the Mesh)

D Central embraces containers but adapts them for edge computing:

### Lightweight Runtime Options

Not every node can run Docker. We support multiple runtimes:

1. **Full Containers** (Tier 2-3): Docker/Podman for complex services
2. **Lightweight Containers** (Tier 1): K3s for resource-constrained devices
3. **WASM Functions** (Tier 1): WebAssembly for sandboxed compute
4. **Native Binaries** (Tier 0-1): Static binaries for minimal overhead

### Edge-Optimized Images

Standard container practices, mesh-specific optimizations:

```dockerfile
# Multi-stage build for minimal size
FROM rust:1.75 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY Cargo.toml Cargo.lock ./
COPY src ./src
RUN cargo build --release --target=aarch64-unknown-linux-musl

# Runtime image
FROM scratch
COPY --from=builder /app/target/aarch64-unknown-linux-musl/release/weather-service /
COPY --from=builder /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/

# Mesh-specific labels
LABEL mesh.service="neighborhood-weather" \
      mesh.version="2.1.0" \
      mesh.capabilities="temperature,humidity,air_quality" \
      mesh.tier.min="1" \
      mesh.tier.max="3"

EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["/weather-service"]
```

Final image: 12MB. Runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero.

### Resource Limits That Make Sense

Edge nodes aren't cloud servers. Resource limits reflect reality:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: weather-service
  namespace: mesh-apps
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: weather
        image: registry.mesh/weather:2.1.0
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "100m"
            mesh/bandwidth: "1Mbps"
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
            mesh/bandwidth: "5Mbps"
        env:
        - name: MESH_TIER
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.annotations['mesh.tier']
        - name: POWER_MODE
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              fieldPath: metadata.annotations['mesh.power-source']
```

The scheduler considers mesh-specific resources like bandwidth and power mode when placing containers.

## Observability: See Everything, Store Efficiently

Distributed systems need distributed observability. But we can't store terabytes of logs on edge nodes:

### eBPF-Powered Metrics

Every node runs eBPF programs that expose flow data:

```python
# Automatic metrics from kernel
flow_metrics = {
  "packets_forwarded": 1847293,
  "bytes_forwarded": 2394857632,
  "flows_active": 347,
  "latency_p50": 12.3,  # milliseconds
  "latency_p99": 45.7,
  "drop_rate": 0.0002,
  "error_rate": 0.0001
}

# Application-level tracking
app_metrics = {
  "weather_api_requests": 8472,
  "weather_api_latency_ms": 23.4,
  "cache_hit_rate": 0.84,
  "sensor_readings_processed": 183746
}
```

These metrics flow to Prometheus servers at Tier-2 nodes, with automatic aggregation and downsampling.

### Grafana Dashboards Out of the Box

Import one dashboard ID, see your entire app:

```bash
# Import mesh-aware dashboards
curl -X POST http://grafana.mesh/api/dashboards/import \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "dashboard": {
      "id": 12345,
      "title": "D Central App Performance"
    },
    "overwrite": true
  }'
```

The dashboard automatically discovers your services and builds panels for:
- Request rates and latencies
- Error rates by endpoint
- Resource usage by node tier
- Mesh topology impact on performance
- Power consumption by service

### Distributed Tracing

Track requests across the mesh with Jaeger integration:

```javascript
// Automatic trace propagation
const trace = mesh.startTrace('weather-request');

// Make service calls - traces propagate automatically
const sensorData = await sensorService.getReading();
const processed = await mlService.analyze(sensorData);
const stored = await storageService.save(processed);

trace.finish();

// View in Jaeger UI
// Shows: Client -> Edge Node -> ML Service -> Storage Service
// With latencies, retry attempts, and mesh routing decisions
```

## CI/CD: GitOps for the Edge

Deploying to hundreds of mesh nodes sounds like a nightmare. GitOps makes it trivial:

### The Pipeline

```yaml
# .mesh/deploy.yaml
name: Deploy Weather Service
on:
  push:
    tags: ['v*']

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: mesh-builder
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Build multi-arch images
        run: |
          buildah build \
            --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7 \
            --tag registry.mesh/weather:${{ github.ref_name }} \
            .
      
      - name: Push to mesh registry
        run: |
          buildah push registry.mesh/weather:${{ github.ref_name }}
      
      - name: Update manifest
        run: |
          sed -i "s/version:.*/version: ${{ github.ref_name }}/" \
            manifests/weather-service.yaml
          git commit -am "Deploy ${{ github.ref_name }}"
          git push origin main

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: mesh-deployer
    steps:
      - name: Trigger Flux sync
        run: |
          flux reconcile source git mesh-apps
          flux reconcile kustomization mesh-apps
```

Push a tag, grab coffee, watch your app roll out across the mesh.

### Progressive Rollouts

Don't deploy everywhere at once:

```yaml
# Canary deployment
apiVersion: flagger.app/v1beta1
kind: Canary
metadata:
  name: weather-service
spec:
  targetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: weather-service
  progressDeadlineSeconds: 300
  service:
    port: 8080
  analysis:
    interval: 1m
    threshold: 5
    maxWeight: 50
    stepWeight: 10
    metrics:
    - name: error-rate
      thresholdRange:
        max: 0.01  # 1% error rate
    - name: latency
      thresholdRange:
        max: 100  # 100ms p99
```

New versions roll out gradually. If errors spike, automatic rollback. Your neighbors never notice the failed deployment.

## Sample Use Cases: From Simple to Mind-Blowing

### Edge AI: Wildlife Camera Classification

Deploy TensorFlow Lite models to camera nodes:

```python
# Runs on solar-powered Tier-1 node with camera
import tflite_runtime.interpreter as tflite
from mesh import ServiceRegistry, EdgeStorage

class WildlifeClassifier:
    def __init__(self):
        self.interpreter = tflite.Interpreter(
            model_path='/models/mobilenet_v2_wildlife.tflite'
        )
        self.storage = EdgeStorage('wildlife-sightings')
        
    async def process_image(self, image_path):
        # Run inference locally
        input_data = preprocess(image_path)
        self.interpreter.set_tensor(input_index, input_data)
        self.interpreter.invoke()
        predictions = self.interpreter.get_tensor(output_index)
        
        # Only upload interesting images
        if max(predictions) > 0.8:  # High confidence
            species = self.labels[np.argmax(predictions)]
            
            # Store locally with replication
            await self.storage.put({
                'image': compress(image_path),
                'species': species,
                'confidence': float(max(predictions)),
                'timestamp': time.now(),
                'location': GPS.current()
            }, replication=3)
            
            # Alert nearby researchers
            await mesh.publish('wildlife/sighting', {
                'species': species,
                'location': GPS.current()
            })
```

The camera runs for months on solar power, only uploading rare species sightings. Researchers get real-time alerts without cloud infrastructure.

### Local CDN: Neighborhood YouTube

CRDT-based storage spreads popular content across the mesh:

```javascript
// Distributed video storage with IPFS-like content addressing
class MeshCDN {
  constructor() {
    this.storage = new CRDTStorage({
      replicationFactor: 5,
      placementStrategy: 'latency-optimized'
    });
  }
  
  async uploadVideo(file, metadata) {
    // Chunk video for distributed storage
    const chunks = await this.chunkFile(file, CHUNK_SIZE);
    
    // Store chunks across mesh with erasure coding
    const handles = await Promise.all(
      chunks.map(chunk => 
        this.storage.put(chunk, {
          erasureCoding: '8+3',  // Tolerate 3 node failures
          tier: '>=1'
        })
      )
    );
    
    // Create manifest
    const manifest = {
      name: metadata.title,
      chunks: handles,
      duration: metadata.duration,
      creator: mesh.identity,
      timestamp: Date.now()
    };
    
    // Announce to mesh
    await mesh.publish('cdn/new-content', manifest);
    
    return manifest.id;
  }
  
  async streamVideo(manifestId) {
    const manifest = await this.storage.get(manifestId);
    
    // Find chunk replicas sorted by latency
    const chunkSources = await Promise.all(
      manifest.chunks.map(chunk =>
        mesh.discover({ content: chunk.id })
          .then(nodes => nodes.sort((a, b) => a.latency - b.latency))
      )
    );
    
    // Stream from nearest sources
    return new ReadableStream({
      async pull(controller) {
        for (let i = 0; i < manifest.chunks.length; i++) {
          const chunk = await this.fetchChunk(
            manifest.chunks[i],
            chunkSources[i]
          );
          controller.enqueue(chunk);
        }
        controller.close();
      }
    });
  }
}
```

Popular videos replicate automatically to nearby nodes. Your neighbor's viral cat video loads instantly because three houses already cached it.

### Community DAO: Governance at the Edge

Smart contracts without blockchain bloat:

```rust
// Runs on Tier-2 nodes with consensus
#[mesh_contract]
pub struct CommunityDAO {
    members: HashMap<PublicKey, Member>,
    proposals: Vec<Proposal>,
    treasury: Balance,
}

#[mesh_contract]
impl CommunityDAO {
    pub fn propose_network_upgrade(&mut self, 
        ctx: Context, 
        upgrade: NetworkUpgrade
    ) -> Result<ProposalId> {
        // Verify proposer is a member
        require!(self.members.contains_key(&ctx.caller));
        
        // Create proposal
        let proposal = Proposal {
            id: generate_id(),
            proposer: ctx.caller,
            action: Action::NetworkUpgrade(upgrade),
            votes_for: 0,
            votes_against: 0,
            deadline: ctx.timestamp + VOTING_PERIOD,
            executed: false,
        };
        
        self.proposals.push(proposal.clone());
        
        // Notify members
        mesh.broadcast(Event::NewProposal(proposal.id));
        
        Ok(proposal.id)
    }
    
    pub fn vote(&mut self, ctx: Context, proposal_id: ProposalId, support: bool) -> Result<()> {
        let member = self.members.get(&ctx.caller)
            .ok_or(Error::NotMember)?;
            
        let proposal = self.proposals.iter_mut()
            .find(|p| p.id == proposal_id)
            .ok_or(Error::ProposalNotFound)?;
            
        // Voting power based on node uptime
        let voting_power = calculate_voting_power(member);
        
        if support {
            proposal.votes_for += voting_power;
        } else {
            proposal.votes_against += voting_power;
        }
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

The mesh governs itself. Software upgrades, resource allocation, and community funds—all decided by the nodes that run the network.

## Performance Considerations

Building for the edge means thinking different:

### Latency-Aware Design
- **Expect 1-50ms** between mesh nodes
- **Design for offline-first** operation
- **Cache aggressively** but invalidate intelligently

### Resource-Conscious Coding
- **Memory is precious**: Stream, don't buffer
- **CPU is limited**: Offload to specialized nodes
- **Battery matters**: Batch operations, sleep often

### Mesh-Native Patterns
- **Eventual consistency** is your friend
- **Partition tolerance** is mandatory  
- **Local-first** with lazy sync to neighbors

## Developer Tools

The mesh loves developers:

### Local Development Environment

```bash
# Spin up a 5-node mesh on your laptop
mesh-dev start --nodes=5 --topology=random

# Deploy your service
mesh-dev deploy ./my-service

# Simulate network conditions
mesh-dev chaos --packet-loss=10% --latency=50ms

# Watch it adapt
mesh-dev monitor
```

### SDK Support

Official SDKs for:
- JavaScript/TypeScript (Node + Browser)
- Python (asyncio native)
- Rust (zero-cost abstractions)
- Go (goroutine-friendly)
- Java/Kotlin (Android-optimized)

### Debugging Tools

When things go wrong:

```bash
# Trace a request across the mesh
mesh-trace --request-id=abc123

# Inspect service registry
mesh-services --node=tier2-node-5

# View distributed logs
mesh-logs --service=weather --since=1h

# Profile resource usage
mesh-profile --service=ml-inference --duration=60s
```

## The Platform Advantage

D Central Mesh isn't just networking—it's a complete platform:

1. **Service discovery** that works offline
2. **Load balancing** across neighbors
3. **State management** with CRDTs
4. **Edge compute** with multiple runtimes
5. **Observability** without the cloud
6. **Security** baked into every layer

Traditional cloud platforms lock you in. The mesh sets you free. Your code runs where it makes sense, scales with your community, and keeps working when the internet doesn't.

## Start Building Today

Ready to join the edge computing revolution?

```bash
# Install the mesh SDK
npm install @dcentral/mesh-sdk

# Initialize a new project
mesh init my-awesome-service

# Run locally
cd my-awesome-service && mesh run

# Deploy to the mesh
mesh deploy
```

Your neighbors are waiting for the next killer app. Maybe it's a hyperlocal food sharing network. Perhaps it's distributed backup for family photos. Or collaborative music creation that works without WiFi.

The mesh is your canvas. What will you build?
