# Windows Desktop Support - Reflections

Personal insights and learning experiences from CST8202.

## Weekly Reflections

### Week 1-2: First Impressions
This course opened my eyes to the depth of Windows administration. I realized that using Windows as a regular user versus managing it as an IT professional are completely different experiences. The installation process taught me about the importance of planning and documentation.

### Week 3-4: User Management Complexity
Managing users and groups seemed simple at first, but I quickly learned about the security implications of improper permission assignments. The principle of least privilege makes much more sense now after seeing how easily permissions can escalate.

### Week 5-6: NTFS Permissions Challenge
Understanding the interaction between share permissions and NTFS permissions was initially confusing. Creating permission matrices and calculating effective permissions helped me grasp the concept. I now appreciate why proper permission design is crucial for security.

### Week 7-8: Networking Revelations
Configuring network settings in Windows connected my networking theory to practical application. Troubleshooting DNS issues using nslookup and understanding DHCP leases gave me confidence in solving real-world network problems.

### Week 9-10: Storage Management Insights
Working with Disk Management and learning about different volume types (simple, spanned, striped) was eye-opening. I gained appreciation for proper backup strategies after simulating data loss scenarios.

### Week 11-12: Performance Tuning Skills
Using Performance Monitor to identify bottlenecks taught me that system slowness isn't always obvious. Learning to read Event Viewer logs transformed how I approach troubleshooting - logs tell the story of what happened.

### Week 13-14: Security Awareness
Configuring Windows Defender and Firewall made me realize how many attack vectors exist. BitLocker encryption labs showed me the importance of data protection. The troubleshooting methodologies will be invaluable in my IT career.
