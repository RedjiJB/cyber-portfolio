# Communications I - Reflections

Personal insights on developing professional communication skills throughout ENL1813T.

## Weeks 1–3: Professional Formats

**What I Learned:**
Learning professional tone and formatting improved how I communicate in academic and workplace settings. Understanding the difference between formal memos and emails helped me choose the right format for different situations.

**Challenge:**
Initially struggled with finding the right balance between being too casual and overly formal. Practice helped me develop an appropriate professional voice.

**Key Insight:**
Clear, concise communication is more valued than complex vocabulary. Simple language doesn't mean simple thinking.

## Weeks 4–6: Grammar Mastery

**What I Learned:**
Grammar practice reminded me that small errors can affect credibility. Clarity matters more than complexity.

**Breakthrough Moment:**
Understanding active vs. passive voice transformed my writing. Active voice makes technical documentation clearer and more direct.

**Challenge:**
Comma placement and semicolon usage took practice. I learned that proper punctuation guides readers through my ideas.

## Weeks 7–9: Technical Writing

**What I Learned:**
Writing summaries and reports taught me to extract core meaning efficiently—a skill that transfers to technical documentation.

**Key Insight:**
Good technical writing isn't about showing off vocabulary; it's about making complex topics accessible to your audience.

**Real-World Application:**
I can now write incident reports, documentation, and technical explanations that non-technical stakeholders can understand.

## Weeks 10–12: Reports and Research

**What I Learned:**
Report writing showed me how structure and visuals strengthen understanding. Proper formatting makes information easier to process.

**Challenge:**
Integrating visuals (charts, tables) with text required planning. I learned to let data tell the story.

**Key Insight:**
A well-structured report guides readers to your conclusion naturally. The introduction sets expectations, findings provide evidence, and recommendations offer action.

## Weeks 13–15: Presentations

**What I Learned:**
The presentation assignment helped me find my professional voice. I became more comfortable explaining technical concepts clearly.

**Breakthrough Moment:**
Realized that nervousness is normal—preparation and practice are the antidotes. Recording myself revealed habits I needed to improve.

**Challenge:**
Managing time while presenting. I learned to script transitions and practice with a timer.

**Growth:**
Public speaking shifted from anxiety-inducing to empowering. I can now confidently present technical topics to diverse audiences.
