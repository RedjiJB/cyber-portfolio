# WiFi Security Auditor

A comprehensive educational tool for demonstrating wireless network security analysis concepts and vulnerabilities.

## üéØ Purpose

This WiFi Security Auditor is a **simulation designed for educational purposes only**. It demonstrates how security professionals analyze wireless networks and identify common vulnerabilities.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Notice

**IMPORTANT**: This is a simulation tool. In real-world scenarios:
- Only scan networks you own or have explicit written permission to test
- Unauthorized network scanning may be illegal in your jurisdiction
- Always follow ethical hacking guidelines and local laws

## üöÄ Features

### Security Analysis
- **Encryption Detection**: Identifies WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3, and Open networks
- **Security Classification**: Categorizes networks as High, Medium, or Low security
- **Signal Strength Analysis**: Visual representation with signal bars
- **Channel & Frequency**: Shows 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz band information
- **BSSID Tracking**: Displays MAC addresses for each access point

### Vulnerability Detection
- **WPS Vulnerabilities**: Identifies networks vulnerable to WPS PIN brute force attacks
- **Weak Encryption**: Detects outdated protocols (WEP, WPA)
- **Open Networks**: Highlights unencrypted networks
- **Hidden Networks**: Finds networks not broadcasting SSID
- **Detailed Explanations**: Provides educational information about each vulnerability

### Scan Options
- **Hidden Network Detection**: Toggle to find non-broadcasting SSIDs
- **WPS Vulnerability Check**: Enable/disable WPS vulnerability scanning
- **Deep Security Analysis**: Extended scanning for comprehensive results

### Professional Reporting
- **JSON Export**: Complete technical data with vulnerability analysis
- **CSV Export**: Spreadsheet-compatible format for data analysis
- **PDF Report**: Placeholder for production implementation
- **Summary Statistics**: Quick overview of security metrics

## üìä Security Concepts Demonstrated

### Encryption Protocols
- **WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)**
  - Status: Completely broken
  - Vulnerability: Can be cracked in minutes
  - Recommendation: Never use

- **WPA (WiFi Protected Access)**
  - Status: Outdated
  - Vulnerability: TKIP weaknesses
  - Recommendation: Upgrade to WPA2/WPA3

- **WPA2**
  - Status: Secure (without WPS)
  - Vulnerability: WPS PIN brute force
  - Recommendation: Disable WPS

- **WPA3**
  - Status: Most secure
  - Features: Enhanced encryption, protection against offline attacks
  - Recommendation: Use when available

### Common Vulnerabilities

1. **WPS PIN Attack**
   - Method: Brute force 8-digit PIN
   - Time: Hours to days
   - Prevention: Disable WPS

2. **Hidden SSID**
   - Misconception: Provides security
   - Reality: Easily discovered, causes connectivity issues
   - Recommendation: Use proper encryption instead

3. **Open Networks**
   - Risk: All traffic visible
   - Attacks: Man-in-the-middle, packet sniffing
   - Protection: Use VPN on open networks

## üö¶ Usage Instructions

1. **Starting a Scan**
   ```
   1. Open index.html in a web browser
