# Building While Doing
## The 24-Month Roadmap from Emergency to Sovereignty

> *"Premye Defans" (First Defense) - how Haiti can build security sovereignty before the next international mission packs up and leaves.*

## The Urgency of Now: Building Permanent Solutions

In October 2025, the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission's mandate expires. By then, Haiti must have viable alternatives to the $600-million-per-year international presence, or face another security vacuum like those that followed previous mission departures.

The 24-month roadmap transforms this deadline from a crisis into an opportunity. Rather than rushing to create dependency-based alternatives, the timeline creates space for building genuine sovereignty through community ownership, democratic governance, and sustainable economics.

The 24-month roadmap transforms abstract vision into concrete reality through systematic implementation that builds capabilities while maintaining community ownership and democratic governance. By October 2025, Haiti's pilot communities will demonstrate that alternatives to expensive international interventions exist—alternatives that build community wealth rather than extracting it, that strengthen democratic governance rather than undermining it, and that create permanent capabilities rather than temporary stability.
