## The Expensive Cycle of Failure

In October 2025, the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission in Haiti will face the same question that has haunted international interventions for three decades: **What happens when we leave?**

The numbers are staggering. The MSS mission costs approximately **$600 million annually** to deploy **2,500 foreign officers** with imported equipment and external logistics chains [1]. Before that, **MINUSTAH consumed over $7 billion** across 13 years [2]. Each mission promises stability, delivers temporary improvements, then departs—leaving Haiti's fundamental security challenges unchanged.

This isn't just expensive. It's a **systematic failure** of development thinking.

### Historical Context: Three Decades of Intervention

Since the fall of the Duvalier regime in 1986, Haiti has experienced a revolving door of international interventions. The pattern began in earnest in 1994 with Operation Uphold Democracy, when 20,000 U.S. troops deployed to restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power [3]. This was followed by a series of UN missions, including:

* **1994-1996**: United Nations Mission in Haiti (UNMIH)
* **1996-1997**: United Nations Support Mission in Haiti (UNSMIH)
* **1997**: United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti (UNTMIH)
* **1997-2000**: United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH)
* **2004-2017**: United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH)
* **2017-2019**: United Nations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti (MINUJUSTH)
* **2019-present**: United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH)
* **2023-present**: Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission

Each mission has been larger and more expensive than its predecessor, yet none has created sustainable security or functional institutions [3].

### Current MSS Deployment Reality

Despite the ambitious plans, the MSS mission remains severely understaffed. As of mid-2025, only **991 personnel** out of the planned 2,500 have been deployed [1], including:
* Approximately 700 Kenyans (the lead contingent)
* 150 Guatemalans
* 78 Salvadorans
* 23 Jamaicans
* 6 Bahamians
* 2 Belizeans

This understaffing has significantly limited the mission's effectiveness, with the Kenyan President publicly acknowledging that the MSS forces have "made little progress in fighting the gangs" [1]. The gap between planned and actual deployment reflects both logistical challenges and the reluctance of contributing countries to fully commit to an uncertain mission [4].

### Consider what $600 million actually buys:

* The MSS budget could fund the entire annual operating costs of **Harvard University**.
* It could build **12,000 affordable housing units**.
* It could provide **primary education for 2.4 million Haitian children** for a full year [5].
* It could fund the construction of **600 community health centers** that would serve rural Haitians for decades [5].
* In Haiti, it represents approximately **1.2-3% of the country's GDP** [6] (depending on calculation method), funneled primarily to foreign personnel, foreign contractors, and foreign equipment—none of which remain when missions end.

### The dependency cycle is predictable:

1. Crisis emerges
2. Foreign mission deploys
3. Temporary stability
4. Mission withdraws
5. Worse crisis than before

This pattern has repeated since **1994** with multiple UN missions [3]. Each new intervention costs more and achieves less. The issue is not Haitian incapacity—it's a flawed model that manufactures dependency rather than building sovereignty.

## Funding Challenges and International Support

The MSS mission is severely underfunded. While the UN Trust Fund for the mission has received pledges of $96.8 million, this falls far short of what's needed for full deployment [4]. The United States has been the largest donor, providing $360 million [4], but as a UN official warned, without increased voluntary contributions, there's a real risk the mission "will never be fully equipped, fully deployed or able to sustain its support for the Haitian National Police" [4].

Unlike previous UN peacekeeping operations like MINUSTAH, which was funded through assessed contributions from member states, the MSS relies entirely on voluntary contributions [4]. This funding model has created significant challenges and operational delays. There are ongoing discussions about potentially transforming the MSS into a UN peacekeeping operation to ensure more reliable funding [4].

### The Political Complexity of Funding

The funding challenges reflect deeper political realities. Many potential donor countries remain hesitant to commit resources to what they see as a potentially open-ended mission with uncertain outcomes [4]. The voluntary funding model also creates inherent instability—donor priorities shift, political winds change, and budget constraints emerge, all of which can lead to sudden funding cuts that compromise mission effectiveness [4].

This funding uncertainty has real operational consequences. Without predictable resources, the MSS mission cannot:
* Plan for long-term capacity building
* Invest in necessary equipment and infrastructure
* Attract and retain qualified personnel
* Build trust with local communities through sustained engagement

Potential contributing countries also face domestic political challenges. Many governments struggle to justify spending on foreign security missions to their constituents, especially when domestic security needs are also pressing. This creates a political calculus that often leads to minimal contributions rather than meaningful commitments [4].

## Where the Money Really Goes

Let's break down how the $600 million is spent:

### MSS Budget Allocation Breakdown

| Category       | Allocation        | Examples                                                              |
| -------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Personnel**  | 75% ($450M/year) | 2,500 foreign officers, deployment allowances, hardship pay, training |
| **Equipment**  | 20% ($120M/year) | Imported vehicles, weapons, comms gear, foreign maintenance contracts |
| **Operations** | 5% ($30M/year)   | Logistics, external command, reporting, admin overhead                |

While specific data on MSS local funding is limited, previous missions have channeled very little of their budget into Haitian institutions or capacity-building initiatives.

### The Economic Paradox of Foreign Missions

Foreign security missions create an economic paradox in Haiti. On one hand, they inject significant foreign currency into the local economy through:
* Rental of properties for mission personnel
* Procurement of some local goods and services
* Employment of Haitian support staff
* Patronage of local businesses by mission personnel

On the other hand, this economic activity creates artificial and unsustainable market distortions [5]:
* Real estate prices in areas frequented by mission personnel skyrocket, making housing unaffordable for locals
* Local businesses orient toward serving mission personnel rather than developing sustainable local markets
* Talented Haitians are drawn to service jobs with missions rather than building local institutions
* The economy becomes dependent on the mission's presence, creating economic shock when the mission departs

When the MSS mission eventually ends:

* Foreign salaries stop boosting the Haitian economy.
* Imported equipment breaks down due to lack of local maintenance capacity.
* Operational systems collapse because they rely on external coordination.
* Local businesses dependent on mission personnel lose their customer base.
* Mission-related employment vanishes without transferable skills or alternative opportunities.

**What's left?** The same unresolved security problems that justified the intervention, now compounded by economic dislocation from the mission's departure.

## Haiti's Economic Context

Haiti's economic situation provides critical context for understanding the impact of security missions. The country's economy has been in decline for six consecutive years, with real GDP projected to contract by 4% in fiscal year 2024 [5]. 

According to the IMF, domestic revenue collection has improved slightly to 6.4% of GDP in FY2023 (from 5.3% in FY2022), but remains extremely low compared to other countries in the region [5]. The $600 million spent annually on the MSS mission represents funds that could potentially address some of Haiti's critical development needs if allocated differently.

### Haiti's Multidimensional Crisis

The current security crisis exists within a broader context of overlapping challenges [7]:

**Political Instability**: Since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in July 2021, Haiti has operated without an elected government. The Presidential Transition Council, established in 2024, faces significant legitimacy challenges and struggles to exercise authority beyond Port-au-Prince. Elections planned for 2025 face serious logistical and security obstacles.

**Economic Deterioration**: Even before the current security crisis, Haiti was the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, with approximately 60% of the population living below the poverty line. The security situation has further damaged economic activity by:
* Disrupting agricultural production and market access
* Halting most manufacturing and formal sector activity
* Cutting transportation links between regions
* Driving businesses to close or relocate to the Dominican Republic

**Humanitarian Emergency**: Approximately 5.2 million Haitians (nearly half the population) face acute food insecurity. Access to healthcare, education, and basic services has collapsed in many areas. Internal displacement has reached unprecedented levels, with over 300,000 people forced from their homes by gang violence [7].

**Infrastructure Collapse**: Haiti's already fragile infrastructure has deteriorated further. Power generation is intermittent at best, water systems are compromised, and public facilities like schools and hospitals have been systematically targeted by armed groups.

Against this backdrop, expensive security missions with limited long-term impact represent a particularly inefficient use of international resources.

## The Hidden Costs of Temporary Solutions

Beyond the headline cost, foreign-led security missions carry **hidden burdens** that weaken Haiti's sovereignty over time:

### Hidden Costs of Dependency-Based Missions

| Hidden Cost             | Description                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Opportunity Cost**    | $600M could build infrastructure, schools, clinics, and jobs for lasting prosperity         |
| **Brain Drain**         | Foreign missions hire Haiti's best talent, who then emigrate post-deployment                 |
| **Institutional Loss**  | Foreign systems temporarily outperform local ones, undermining trust in Haitian institutions |
| **Economic Distortion** | Short-lived economic booms vanish after mission withdrawal                                   |
| **Sovereignty Loss**    | Each mission deepens dependency and reinforces the myth of Haitian incapacity                |

### The Psychological Impact on Governance

Perhaps the most insidious cost is psychological. Repeated cycles of foreign intervention create a profound learned helplessness within Haitian institutions [7]. Local officials come to believe that:
* Solutions must come from outside
* Local initiatives aren't worth pursuing since foreign actors will eventually take over
* Technical capacity can only be imported, not developed locally
* Haitian-led approaches are inherently inferior to foreign models

This psychological dependency becomes self-reinforcing. Local officials defer to foreign experts, even in areas where local knowledge is superior. Haitian institutions wait for external direction rather than exercising initiative. Public trust in local governance erodes further, creating a vicious cycle that justifies the next round of foreign intervention [7].

## Lessons from MINUSTAH: A Legacy of Controversy

The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), which operated from 2004-2017 at a total cost of $7 billion, offers cautionary lessons for current and future security missions [2].

While MINUSTAH initially helped reduce gang violence in some areas [8], it was marred by serious scandals that damaged the reputation of UN peacekeeping in Haiti:

### The Cholera Epidemic: A Public Health Catastrophe

In October 2010, just months after Haiti's devastating earthquake, cholera appeared in the country for the first time in over a century. The outbreak originated near a MINUSTAH base in Mirebalais, where Nepalese peacekeepers had recently arrived from an area experiencing a cholera outbreak. Epidemiological studies conclusively linked the genetic strain to Nepal [2].

The cholera epidemic ultimately caused:
* Approximately 820,000 cases of illness
* Nearly 10,000 documented deaths (with the actual toll likely higher)
* Overwhelming of Haiti's already fragile healthcare system
* Lasting distrust of foreign interventions

The UN initially denied responsibility, taking six years to formally acknowledge its role. A promised $400 million victim compensation fund raised less than $20 million, and most victims received no compensation at all [2].

### Sexual Exploitation and Abuse: A Pattern of Predation

Throughout MINUSTAH's deployment, the mission was plagued by allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse:

* A ring of at least 134 Sri Lankan peacekeepers sexually exploited and abused children as young as 12 years old. Though the soldiers were repatriated, none served prison time [2].

* Five Uruguayan peacekeepers gang-raped a Haitian teenager and filmed the assault on a cellphone. They were eventually convicted only of "private violence" by a Uruguayan military court [2].

* A comprehensive study by researchers found that peacekeepers fathered hundreds of children who were then abandoned when the soldiers returned home [2].

* Victims faced formidable barriers to justice, including complex legal jurisdictions, lack of victim support services, and immunity provisions that protected UN personnel [2].

### Human Rights Abuses and Excessive Force

MINUSTAH forces were implicated in multiple incidents of excessive force and human rights violations against civilians [2]:

* In July 2005, a raid on Cité Soleil targeting gang members resulted in numerous civilian casualties. While the UN claimed only precision targeting of gang leaders, human rights organizations documented dozens of civilian deaths [2].

* Arbitrary detentions were widespread, with thousands of Haitians held without formal charges or due process, sometimes for extended periods [2].

* Peaceful protests were met with disproportionate force on multiple occasions, including the use of tear gas against demonstrators protesting the cholera outbreak [2].

These controversies have created significant skepticism about international security missions in Haiti and highlight the critical importance of robust accountability mechanisms in any security intervention.

## MINUSTAH's Operational Lessons

Beyond the scandals, MINUSTAH's 13-year deployment offers important operational lessons [8]:

**What Worked:**
* Coordination between military and police components in targeted anti-gang operations
* Community-based policing initiatives in some neighborhoods
* Technical training programs for the Haitian National Police
* Infrastructure protection during periods of unrest

**What Failed:**
* Building sustainable local security institutions
* Addressing root causes of instability and violence
* Adapting to changing security dynamics and emerging threats
* Transitioning from international to local security provision
* Maintaining public trust and legitimacy

These operational lessons remain largely unincorporated into the MSS mission design, suggesting that the same shortcomings may be repeated [4].

## The Success Mythology

International donors claim success by cherry-picking short-term metrics:

* Decrease in gang activity during deployment
* Temporary restoration of public services
* Perception of order and responsiveness

But these metrics vanish post-departure. The **real long-term failure** is reframed as a **new crisis**, justifying the next intervention.

### Measuring What Matters: Sustainable Security Indicators

The traditional metrics used to evaluate security missions focus on outputs rather than outcomes, on quantity rather than quality, and on immediate rather than sustainable impacts [8]. These include:

* Number of patrols conducted
* Quantity of weapons seized
* Personnel trained
* Equipment delivered
* Incidents responded to

A more meaningful assessment would measure indicators of sustainable security capacity [8]:

* **Institutional Resilience**: Can security institutions maintain effectiveness after foreign support ends?
* **Democratic Accountability**: Do security forces answer to civilian democratic oversight?
* **Public Trust**: Do communities view security forces as legitimate protectors rather than threats?
* **Financial Sustainability**: Can security operations continue without external funding?
* **Adaptability**: Can security institutions evolve to address changing threats?

By these more meaningful metrics, virtually every security mission in Haiti has failed, despite achieving temporary tactical successes that feature prominently in donor reports [8].

### Who Benefits from This Cycle?

| Stakeholder            | Interest Served                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **International Orgs** | Justify mandates and global relevance               |
| **Donor Countries**    | Showcase support without long-term commitment       |
| **Contractors**        | Reap billions from equipment, logistics, training   |
| **Media**              | Prefer dramatic deployments over slow, civic reform |
| **Mission Personnel**  | Career advancement and field experience             |
| **Political Elites**   | Maintain access to resources and external support   |

> Meanwhile, Haitians receive temporary stability they can't sustain, economic benefits they can't retain, and institutions they can't develop.

### The True Cost of Failure

The cost of this cycle extends far beyond wasted money. Each failed intervention:

* Further erodes Haitian trust in both international partners and local institutions
* Creates periods of intense violence during transitions between missions
* Deepens dependency on external support for basic security functions
* Diverts attention and resources from long-term solutions
* Reinforces narratives of Haitian incapacity and failure

The human toll is immeasurable—lives lost during security vacuums, economic opportunities foregone during periods of instability, and generational trauma from recurring cycles of violence [7].

## What Real Security Costs

The MSS model deploys 2,500 foreign officers at **$240,000 each per year**. But what if that same $600M were spent **differently**?

### Alternative Investments for Sovereign Security

| Investment                          | Cost Per Unit | Outcome                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **25,000 Local Security Personnel** | $24,000/year | 10x workforce, permanent presence, cultural fluency              |
| **Community Infrastructure**        | —             | Solar CCTV, owned communications, local data centers             |
| **Security Cooperatives**           | —             | Self-sustaining local economic engines through service contracts |
| **Democratic Oversight Mechanisms** | —             | Locally legitimate, transparent, community-driven governance     |

This isn't just about economics—it's about **building sovereignty** through ownership, accountability, and permanence.

### Comparative Case Studies: Community Security Models

Alternative approaches to security have demonstrated success in contexts similar to Haiti [9]:

**Colombia's Community Security Councils**: In regions previously controlled by armed groups, community-led security councils work in partnership with police to identify priorities, develop strategies, and oversee implementation. This model has reduced violence by up to 67% in participating communities while building local institutional capacity [9].

**El Salvador's Municipal Violence Prevention Committees**: Despite the country's challenges with gang violence, locally-controlled prevention committees have created significant security improvements in participating municipalities. By integrating security with economic development, education, and youth engagement, these committees address root causes while responding to immediate threats [9].

**Sierra Leone's Post-Conflict Community Policing**: Following civil war, Sierra Leone rebuilt its security sector using a community-oriented approach that emphasized local oversight, cultural integration, and sustainable resource models. The program costs approximately one-tenth of comparable UN missions while creating more sustainable capacity [9].

**Philippines' Barangay Justice System**: Local community justice structures handle approximately 80% of disputes and minor offenses, dramatically reducing the burden on formal courts and police while maintaining cultural relevance and community legitimacy [9].

These models share common elements that distinguish them from foreign-led security missions:
* Community leadership and ownership
* Integration with local cultural and governance structures
* Emphasis on prevention alongside enforcement
* Economic sustainability through local resource models
* Progressive capacity building rather than temporary substitution

---

## Alternative Community-Based Approaches

Several experts have proposed alternative approaches that would build local capacity rather than relying on external forces [10]:

* **Community-Owned Security Infrastructure**: Developing security systems that are owned, maintained, and governed by local communities, ensuring sustainability after international support ends.

* **Local Training and Employment**: Creating permanent jobs and career pathways for Haitians in security and related fields, rather than importing external expertise.

* **Democratic Governance Structures**: Establishing transparent oversight mechanisms that ensure security forces remain accountable to the communities they serve.

* **Economic Integration**: Designing security systems that contribute to local economic development through procurement, employment, and service provision.

* **Technological Sovereignty**: Building local capacity to maintain, repair, and improve security technology, reducing dependency on external technical support.

### The Haiti Community Security Model

A comprehensive alternative to foreign-led missions would incorporate these elements into a cohesive model [10]:

**Cooperative Ownership Structure**: Security infrastructure and resources would be owned by community cooperatives with democratic governance. This structure ensures accountability to local priorities while creating sustainable economic models.

**Phased Capacity Development**:
* **Phase 1 (0-6 months)**: Deploy basic security capabilities while beginning local training
* **Phase 2 (6-18 months)**: Transition operational responsibility to local personnel with external mentorship
* **Phase 3 (18-36 months)**: Develop advanced capabilities and begin exporting expertise to other communities

**Integrated Economic Model**: Security cooperatives would generate revenue through service contracts with businesses, NGOs, and government agencies. This creates financial sustainability while keeping resources circulating within the community.

**Federation Structure**: Individual community security cooperatives would connect through voluntary federation, enabling collective action against shared threats while maintaining local sovereignty over operations and resources.

**International Partnership**: Rather than substituting for local capacity, international partners would provide technical assistance, specialized training, and initial funding under community direction and oversight.

These approaches would require significant upfront investment in capacity building, but would create sustainable security institutions that remain effective long after international funding ends.

## Accountability Mechanisms: Preventing Abuses

Any security mission in Haiti must include robust accountability mechanisms to prevent the abuses seen in previous interventions [2]:

* **Independent Oversight**: External monitoring bodies with the power to investigate and sanction misconduct.

* **Community Participation**: Formal roles for Haitian civil society in oversight and governance.

* **Transparent Reporting**: Regular public disclosure of operational activities, spending, and outcomes.

* **Clear Complaint Procedures**: Accessible channels for Haitians to report misconduct or abuse.

* **Legal Accountability**: Removal of immunity provisions that shield international personnel from legal consequences for criminal behavior.

### Designing Accountability Systems That Work

Experience with previous missions demonstrates that generic accountability measures often fail to prevent abuses [2]. Effective accountability requires specific mechanisms designed for the Haitian context:

**Community Oversight Committees**: Locally-elected committees with real authority to:
* Review security operations and resource allocation
* Investigate complaints against security personnel
* Recommend disciplinary action and policy changes
* Monitor implementation of recommendations

**Independent Complaint Mechanism**: An accessible system that enables Haitians to report misconduct safely and receive timely responses, including:
* Multiple reporting channels (phone, text, in-person, third-party)
* Protection for whistleblowers and complainants
* Transparent case tracking and resolution
* Regular public reporting on cases and outcomes

**Joint Investigation Teams**: Mixed teams of international and Haitian investigators with:
* Authority to access all mission facilities and personnel
* Power to collect evidence and interview witnesses
* Mandate to recommend prosecution where appropriate
* Resources to conduct thorough and timely investigations

**Legal Jurisdiction Agreements**: Clear agreements establishing legal liability for criminal conduct, including:
* Waiver of immunity for serious crimes
* Commitment to prosecute offenders in home countries
* Recognition of Haitian court jurisdiction in appropriate cases
* Victim compensation mechanisms

**Preventive Measures**: Proactive steps to reduce the risk of abuse, including:
* Rigorous personnel vetting before deployment
* Comprehensive training on human rights and cultural sensitivity
* Clear codes of conduct with consequences for violations
* Regular rotation of personnel to prevent exploitative relationships

Such mechanisms would help ensure that security missions serve their intended purpose of protecting Haitian communities while respecting human rights and dignity.

## The Geopolitical Context: Regional Security Implications

Haiti's security challenges exist within a broader regional context that affects both the Caribbean and North America [7]. Instability in Haiti has far-reaching consequences:

**Migration Pressures**: Security breakdowns drive Haitians to flee, creating humanitarian challenges and political tensions in neighboring countries and as far away as the United States and Canada.

**Transnational Crime**: Criminal networks exploit Haiti's governance gaps to establish trafficking routes for drugs, weapons, and people that affect the entire region.

**Regional Stability**: Haiti's instability creates spillover effects in the Dominican Republic and other Caribbean nations, threatening economic development and security across the region.

**Great Power Competition**: Haiti has become an arena for influence competition, with China, Russia, and Western powers pursuing different agendas regarding Haiti's future.

These regional dimensions underscore the importance of finding sustainable security solutions, not just for Haiti's sake but for regional stability. However, they also highlight the risk that security interventions may serve external geopolitical interests rather than Haitian needs [7].

## Beyond the Dependency Cycle

To break free of this loop, Haiti and its partners must embrace **a new model of security**:

* **Owned by communities**
* **Guided by democratic values**
* **Integrated with local economies**

The solution is not **no support**—but **a different kind of support**:

* Fund cooperatives, not contractors
* Equip local talent, not foreign specialists
* Build governance structures that last beyond the donor cycle

This transformation demands honesty, courage, and **a shift from managing crises to building sovereignty**.

---

## The $600 Million Question

Should international support continue? Absolutely.

But the real question is: **Will it keep creating dependency—or finally build Haitian sovereignty?**

Haiti's future security depends on getting that answer right.
