# The \$600 Million Question: Why Foreign Security Missions Keep Failing in Haiti

*Every year, international donors spend hundreds of millions on security missions that pack up and leave when funding ends. There's a better way.*

---

## The Expensive Cycle of Failure

In October 2025, the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission in Haiti will face the same question that has haunted international interventions for three decades: **What happens when we leave?**

The numbers are staggering. The MSS mission costs approximately **\$600 million annually** to deploy **2,500 foreign officers** with imported equipment and external logistics chains. Before that, **MINUSTAH consumed over \$7 billion** across 13 years. Each mission promises stability, delivers temporary improvements, then departs—leaving Haiti's fundamental security challenges unchanged.

This isn't just expensive. It's a **systematic failure** of development thinking.

### Consider what \$600 million actually buys:

* The MSS budget could fund the entire annual operating costs of **Harvard University**.
* It could build **12,000 affordable housing units**.
* In Haiti, it represents nearly **15% of the country's GDP**, funneled to foreign personnel, foreign contractors, and foreign equipment—none of which remain when missions end.

### The dependency cycle is predictable:

1. Crisis emerges
2. Foreign mission deploys
3. Temporary stability
4. Mission withdraws
5. Worse crisis than before

This pattern has repeated since **1994**. Each new intervention costs more and achieves less. The issue is not Haitian incapacity—it's a flawed model that manufactures dependency rather than building sovereignty.

## Where the Money Really Goes

Let’s break down how the \$600 million is spent:

### MSS Budget Allocation Breakdown

| Category       | Allocation        | Examples                                                              |
| -------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Personnel**  | 75% (\$450M/year) | 2,500 foreign officers, deployment allowances, hardship pay, training |
| **Equipment**  | 20% (\$120M/year) | Imported vehicles, weapons, comms gear, foreign maintenance contracts |
| **Operations** | 5% (\$30M/year)   | Logistics, external command, reporting, admin overhead                |

> **Less than 2%** of MSS funding reaches Haitian personnel, institutions, or capacity-building initiatives.

When the MSS mission ends:

* Foreign salaries stop boosting the Haitian economy.
* Imported equipment breaks down due to lack of local maintenance capacity.
* Operational systems collapse because they rely on external coordination.

**What’s left?** The same unresolved security problems that justified the intervention.

## The Hidden Costs of Temporary Solutions

Beyond the headline cost, foreign-led security missions carry **hidden burdens** that weaken Haiti’s sovereignty over time:

### Hidden Costs of Dependency-Based Missions

| Hidden Cost             | Description                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Opportunity Cost**    | \$600M could build infrastructure, schools, clinics, and jobs for lasting prosperity         |
| **Brain Drain**         | Foreign missions hire Haiti's best talent, who then emigrate post-deployment                 |
| **Institutional Loss**  | Foreign systems temporarily outperform local ones, undermining trust in Haitian institutions |
| **Economic Distortion** | Short-lived economic booms vanish after mission withdrawal                                   |
| **Sovereignty Loss**    | Each mission deepens dependency and reinforces the myth of Haitian incapacity                |

## The Success Mythology

International donors claim success by cherry-picking short-term metrics:

* Decrease in gang activity during deployment
* Temporary restoration of public services
* Perception of order and responsiveness

But these metrics vanish post-departure. The **real long-term failure** is reframed as a **new crisis**, justifying the next intervention.

### Who Benefits from This Cycle?

| Stakeholder            | Interest Served                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **International Orgs** | Justify mandates and global relevance               |
| **Donor Countries**    | Showcase support without long-term commitment       |
| **Contractors**        | Reap billions from equipment, logistics, training   |
| **Media**              | Prefer dramatic deployments over slow, civic reform |

> Meanwhile, Haitians receive temporary stability they can’t sustain, economic benefits they can’t retain, and institutions they can’t develop.

## What Real Security Costs

The MSS model deploys 2,500 foreign officers at **\$240,000 each per year**. But what if that same \$600M were spent **differently**?

### Alternative Investments for Sovereign Security

| Investment                          | Cost Per Unit | Outcome                                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **25,000 Local Security Personnel** | \$24,000/year | 10x workforce, permanent presence, cultural fluency              |
| **Community Infrastructure**        | —             | Solar CCTV, owned communications, local data centers             |
| **Security Cooperatives**           | —             | Self-sustaining local economic engines through service contracts |
| **Democratic Oversight Mechanisms** | —             | Locally legitimate, transparent, community-driven governance     |

This isn’t just about economics—it’s about **building sovereignty** through ownership, accountability, and permanence.

## Beyond the Dependency Cycle

To break free of this loop, Haiti and its partners must embrace **a new model of security**:

* **Owned by communities**
* **Guided by democratic values**
* **Integrated with local economies**

The solution is not **no support**—but **a different kind of support**:

* Fund cooperatives, not contractors
* Equip local talent, not foreign specialists
* Build governance structures that last beyond the donor cycle

This transformation demands honesty, courage, and **a shift from managing crises to building sovereignty**.

## The \$600 Million Question

Should international support continue? Absolutely.

But the real question is: **Will it keep creating dependency—or finally build Haitian sovereignty?**

Haiti’s future security depends on getting that answer right.
