# What If Communities Owned Their Own Security? The Haiti Cooperative Model

*A market vendor in Port-au-Prince checks her phone and sees exactly who's watching her street—because she owns part of the camera.*

## Reimagining Security as Community Asset

Marie-Claire sells vegetables in downtown Port-au-Prince. Every morning at 5 AM, she checks her community security app before leaving home. She sees which cameras are operational along her route, whether the mesh network is functioning in the market area, and if any incidents were reported overnight in her neighborhood.

She's not just a consumer of security services—she's an owner. Along with 847 other community members, Marie-Claire holds shares in the Kooperativ Sekirite Kominote (Community Security Cooperative) that operates the cameras, employs the security monitors, and manages the alert systems that protect her route to work.

When the system prevents a robbery at her market stall, Marie-Claire doesn't just feel safer—she receives a dividend. When new cameras are installed on her street, she participates in the democratic process that determines their placement. When security personnel need training, some of that training happens at the vocational school where her son studies, creating local jobs and building local expertise.

This is security as community ownership rather than external service. It's a fundamental reimagining of how protection works in practice.

## From Service to Ownership: The Cooperative Transformation

Traditional security operates as a service relationship: someone provides protection to someone else in exchange for payment. Whether it's private security guards, foreign peacekeepers, or government police, the fundamental dynamic is external entities delivering security to passive recipients.

The cooperative model transforms security into shared ownership of productive assets. Instead of paying indefinitely for temporary protection, communities invest in permanent infrastructure they control democratically. Instead of depending on external providers who may leave, communities build capabilities that remain regardless of political changes or funding fluctuations.

### The Ownership Advantage

| Benefit                   | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Economic Benefits**     | Money circulates locally through employment, contracts, and dividends    |
| **Democratic Control**    | Residents help govern camera placement, data access, training priorities |
| **Technical Sovereignty** | Open-source tools and training allow local adaptation and management     |
| **Sustainable Ops**       | Revenue-generating services replace reliance on donor aid                |

## The Four Pillars of Security Cooperation

### 1. Shared Infrastructure Ownership

Community-owned infrastructure serves **multiple functions**:

* Solar cameras = surveillance + clean energy
* Mesh WiFi = secure comms + community internet
* Edge nodes = AI alerts + public computing access

Result: cost-sharing across services, resilience in crises, and local jobs in installation and maintenance.

### 2. Democratic Governance Structures

| Structure               | Role                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Community Council**   | Elected reps from neighborhoods, businesses, civil society shape policy and spending priorities |
| **Technical Committee** | Guides tech decisions based on open-source community needs                                      |
| **Oversight Board**     | Investigates abuses, resolves disputes, maintains public trust                                  |
| **Economic Advisory**   | Manages budgets, revenue splits, development project funding                                    |

These structures keep power decentralized and community-aligned.

### 3. Sustainable Economic Models

| Income Stream             | Description                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Service Subscriptions** | Monthly payments from local shops, clinics, institutions for tailored monitoring |
| **Event Security**        | Fees for festivals, weddings, and public gatherings                              |
| **Tech Services**         | Installation and training for other cooperatives and clients                     |
| **Data & Analytics**      | Selling trends and reports to NGOs and planners under strict ethical oversight   |

> A typical revenue split: **70% ops**, **20% education/community development**, **10% emergency reserves**

### 4. Community-Integrated Security Personnel

Security officers are from the **same neighborhoods** they serve:

* Hired by cooperatives
* Trained in de-escalation, cultural competence, and rights-based service
* Evaluated through public feedback and local review boards

Result: higher trust, lower misconduct, more effective conflict prevention.

## Real-World Applications: The Port-au-Prince Pilot

**Case: Delmas 32 Cooperative**

| Feature      | Details                                                                          |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Assets**   | 15 solar cameras, mesh WiFi, community hub, encrypted local data logs            |
| **Staff**    | 8 full-time security personnel, 3 technicians, 1 administrator                   |
| **Coverage** | Over 200 households and 35 businesses                                            |
| **Partners** | Haitian National Police (HNP), local churches, youth groups                      |
| **Outcomes** | 2 robberies prevented, 24 tech scholarships awarded, 1 new training center built |

This model is scaling across other neighborhoods using federation principles.

## Beyond Security: Platform for Development

Security cooperatives become springboards for wider transformation:

| Sector               | Contribution from Cooperative Model                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Digital Access**   | Mesh WiFi + edge computing enable education, telehealth, and e-commerce         |
| **Technical Skills** | Local youth gain IT, security tech, maintenance, analytics experience           |
| **Democracy**        | Citizens practice decision-making, budgeting, oversight                         |
| **Jobs**             | Long-term employment in high-demand fields                                      |
| **Community Trust**  | Shared ownership reduces polarization and increases problem-solving cooperation |

## Addressing Common Concerns

**“Can communities manage complex technology?”**
Yes—with open-source tools, training, and transparent documentation. Delmas 32's team maintains all hardware and systems locally.

**“What about law enforcement integration?”**
Cooperatives share data with police under community oversight. They handle local threats, freeing police for serious investigations.

**“Won’t cooperatives risk corruption?”**
Checks and balances include public budgeting, peer audits, rotation of leadership, and external observers.

**“What if the cooperative fails?”**
Infrastructure and knowledge remain community-owned. Institutions inherit functions, ensuring continuity of service.

---

## The Path Forward

Foreign security missions collapse when funding ends. Cooperatives **grow stronger over time** because communities have skin in the game.

International aid should **support cooperatives**, not override them:

* Invest in infrastructure
* Fund initial training and toolkits
* Connect communities to global open-source projects
* Facilitate peer learning networks

This is how Haiti breaks the cycle.

When Marie-Claire checks her phone in the morning, she's not just feeling safe—she’s **governing** it.
