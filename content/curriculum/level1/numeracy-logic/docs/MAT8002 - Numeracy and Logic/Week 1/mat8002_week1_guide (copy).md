## Class 1 Preparation: Basic Decimal Concepts

### 1-1: Decimals and the Decimal Number System
**Key Concepts:**
- Understanding place value (ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, etc.)
- Reading and writing decimal numbers
- Converting between word form and numerical form

**Review Points:**
- Each digit's position determines its value
- The decimal point separates whole numbers from fractional parts
- Place values: ... thousands, hundreds, tens, ones, tenths, hundredths, thousandths ...

### 1-2: Decimal Fractions
**Key Concepts:**
- Converting fractions to decimals
- Converting decimals to fractions
- Understanding terminating vs. repeating decimals

**Practice Skills:**
- Converting common fractions like 1/4 = 0.25, 1/3 = 0.333..., 3/8 = 0.375
- Reducing fractions to lowest terms

### 1-3: Whole Numbers and Fractions
**Key Concepts:**
- Mixed numbers (combining whole numbers and fractions)
- Improper fractions vs. proper fractions
- Converting between mixed numbers and improper fractions

**Examples to Review:**
- 2½ = 5/2 = 2.5
- 7/3 = 2⅓ = 2.333...

### Percent and Percentage
**Key Concepts:**
- Converting between decimals, fractions, and percentages
- Calculating percentages of numbers
- Finding what percent one number is of another

**Essential Conversions:**
- 50% = 0.5 = 1/2
- 25% = 0.25 = 1/4
- 75% = 0.75 = 3/4

### 1-4: Rounding Whole Numbers
**Key Concepts:**
- Rounding rules (5 or greater rounds up)
- Rounding to nearest 10, 100, 1000, etc.
- Understanding when and why to round

**Practice Examples:**
- 1,247 rounded to nearest 10 = 1,250
- 1,247 rounded to nearest 100 = 1,200

### 1-5: Rounding Non-whole Numbers
**Key Concepts:**
- Rounding decimals to specific decimal places
- Rounding to nearest tenth, hundredth, thousandth

**Practice Examples:**
- 3.456 rounded to nearest tenth = 3.5
- 3.456 rounded to nearest hundredth = 3.46

### 1-6: Significant Digits
**Key Concepts:**
- Identifying significant digits in numbers
- Rules for determining significance
- Rounding to a specific number of significant digits

**Significant Digit Rules:**
- All non-zero digits are significant
- Zeros between non-zero digits are significant
- Leading zeros are not significant
- Trailing zeros in decimal numbers are significant

---

## Class 2 Preparation: Operations with Signed Numbers

### 1-7: Addition and Subtraction of Signed Numbers
**Key Concepts:**
- Understanding positive and negative numbers
- Adding numbers with same signs vs. different signs
- Subtracting by adding the opposite

**Rules to Remember:**
- Same signs: Add the numbers, keep the sign
- Different signs: Subtract the smaller from larger, use sign of larger number
- Subtracting = Adding the opposite

### 1-8: Multiplication and Division of Signed Numbers
**Key Concepts:**
- Multiplying and dividing positive and negative numbers
- Sign rules for operations

**Sign Rules:**
- Positive × Positive = Positive
- Negative × Negative = Positive  
- Positive × Negative = Negative
- Same rules apply for division

### 1-9: Mathematical Expressions and Terms
**Key Concepts:**
- Identifying terms, coefficients, and variables
- Combining like terms
- Understanding mathematical expressions

**Vocabulary:**
- **Term:** A number, variable, or product of numbers and variables
- **Coefficient:** The numerical part of a term
- **Like terms:** Terms with same variable parts

### 1-10: Order of Operations
**Key Concepts:**
- BEDMAS/PEMDAS rules
- Working through complex expressions step by step

**Order of Operations:**
1. **B**rackets/Parentheses
2. **E**xponents
3. **D**ivision and **M**ultiplication (left to right)
4. **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (left to right)
